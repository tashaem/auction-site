# CS50 Web Programming with Python and Javascript
### Project 2: E-commerce Auction Site
This eBay-like web app that allows users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a â€œwatchlist". 
In this project, I learned to create and manipulate data by using Django models and Django's admin site.
The views related to user authorization (login, register, logout) was provided by Harvard's CS50 staff in the project's distribution code.
